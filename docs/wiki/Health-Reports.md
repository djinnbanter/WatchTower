# Health Reports

A **health report** is Watchtower’s main check: it reads logs, crashes, mods, backups, and server stats, then writes a short summary and detailed data files.

---

## At a glance

- **Run one:** **Run Report** in the dashboard, `/watchtower run`, or on a schedule — [[Scheduled Reports]]
- **Output files:** `watchtower-brief-*.txt` (readable) and `watchtower-facts-*.json` (for the dashboard) in `<server>/watchtower/`
- **Powers:** **Issues** fix list, deep **Mods** analysis, **Activity** history, and more
- **Faster reruns:** “Incremental” mode only scans since the last report when enabled in Settings

---

## What happens during a report

1. Watchtower scans your server’s logs, crash folder, mod list, backups, and machine stats
2. Rule-based checks find problems (no AI, no cloud)
3. A text summary and JSON file are saved with a timestamp
4. `DR-README.txt` is updated with recovery instructions

## How to run a report

| Method | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Run Report** button | Easiest — in the dashboard top bar |
| Welcome **30-day baseline** | First time setup |
| `/watchtower run [hours]` | From console — optional hours of history |
| Scheduled reports | Hands-off — Settings → General |

**Recommended first report:** 30 days (`/watchtower run 720` or welcome button).

## Output files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `watchtower-brief-*.txt` | Human-readable summary — start here |
| `watchtower-facts-*.json` | Data the dashboard loads |
| `DR-README.txt` | Emergency recovery command |

In-game summary: `/watchtower brief`

## Reports vs live charts vs background scan

| Type | What it does |
|------|----------------|
| **Live charts** | Updates while dashboard is open |
| **Background scan** | Logs, crashes, recent activity ~every minute |
| **Full report** | Complete fix list and deep analysis — run on a schedule |

You do not need a full report every visit, but schedule them regularly for a useful **Issues** tab and history.

---

## Incremental reports

When **Incremental scans** is on in **Settings → General**:

- Only new logs/events since the last report are scanned
- Faster on large servers
- Small overlap prevents gaps at boundaries
